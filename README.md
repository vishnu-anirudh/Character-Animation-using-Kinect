# Character-Animation-using-Kinect
This project implements the animation of a virtual character by imitating a real-user through kinect. Here, many graphics-based software such as Autodesk Maya and Unity game engine were used. The mocaps were used from CMU Graphics Lab Database and UCLIC database (AffectME project). 
More details can be seen in this blog: http://graphics-project-dh2323.blogspot.co.uk/. 
This is done as part of DH2323 Computer Graphics Course in KTH Royal Institute of Technology under the supervision of Prof. Christopher Peters.  
Since this is animation-based rather than code based, the code is not provided here. Also, the 3D models and mocaps created as part of this project cannot be uploaded due to IP protection issues. However, the entire process of the project and the final output can be be seen in the blog mentioned above.
